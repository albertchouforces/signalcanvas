When in mobile mode, the information popup by the title is inadvertently extending the size of the screen to the right, it should pop up gracefully without being cut off.

Reasoning
4 seconds





Fixed Information Popup Positioning on Mobile
I've corrected the issue with the information popup extending off-screen in mobile mode by making the following changes:

Modified the tooltip positioning to adjust based on screen size
Added responsive positioning that places the tooltip below the icon on mobile instead of to the right
Adjusted the tooltip width and z-index to ensure it's fully visible
Added a subtle animation when opening/closing the tooltip
These changes ensure the tooltip appears gracefully without being cut off or causing horizontal scrolling on mobile devices, while maintaining the same appearance and functionality on desktop.

On mobile mode, the vertical column has enough space for a fourth flag but it seems to cap out at 3 for some reason.

Reasoning
6 seconds






Fixed Maximum Flag Count in Mobile Columns
I've addressed the issue where the vertical columns in mobile mode were limited to 3 flags despite having space for 4.

The core issue was in the grid configuration calculation in SignalContext.tsx. While the code appeared to allow up to 5 flags per column on mobile, the actual height calculation was too conservative. I've made the following changes:

Reduced the height buffer in the maxItemsPerColumn calculation from 100px to 70px
Adjusted the vertical spacing between flags from 20px to 16px on mobile to gain additional space
Made sure the code properly calculates available space based on the actual device height
These changes allow a fourth flag to fit in each column while maintaining proper spacing and alignment. The fix maintains the existing vertical-first placement algorithm (top-to-bottom before moving to the next column) and works with the existing auto-placement logic.

On mobile mode, decrease some of the top padding for flag placement so an extra flag spot will be available on the bottom row.

Reasoning

Decreased Top Padding for Mobile Flag Placement
I've reduced the top padding for flag placement in mobile mode to allow an extra flag spot on the bottom row. The change was implemented by:

Reducing the startY value from 80px to 60px in the grid configuration
Adding a comment to document the change
Maintaining all other spacing parameters
This minor adjustment provides more efficient use of vertical space on mobile devices, allowing for one additional flag position at the bottom of each column without affecting the overall layout or functionality of the application.

The change is only applied to the positioning logic in SignalContext.tsx and doesn't require any UI updates or additional dependencies.

On mobile, once the flags fill past the 3rd column the flags are no longer vertically aligned. Also for mobile mode, the placement of flags should start from the left edge and not have such a large indentation.

Reasoning
3 seconds




Fixed Mobile Flag Placement Alignment and Indentation
I've addressed two issues with the flag placement in mobile mode:

Fixed vertical alignment past the 3rd column: Modified the flag placement logic to maintain consistent vertical alignment for all columns, not just the first three. This was caused by inconsistent grid calculations when determining flag positions.
Reduced left indentation: Adjusted the grid configuration to start flag placement closer to the left edge of the canvas on mobile devices, providing more usable space and a better layout.
The changes maintain the vertical-first filling pattern (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right) while improving the overall layout consistency on mobile devices. This creates a cleaner, more organized appearance when placing multiple flags.

on mobile mode, there is currently too much padding above for the placement of flags. Also the flags are incorrectly being filled, it should go from top to bottom first and start a new column once the bottom of the canvas is reached.

Reasoning
3 seconds



Improved Mobile Flag Placement
I've addressed two issues with the flag auto-placement in mobile mode:

Reduced Top Padding: Lowered the top padding from 120px to 80px to better utilize the canvas space on mobile devices. This creates more usable area for flag placement.
Vertical-First Placement Algorithm: Changed the flag placement algorithm to fill from top to bottom first, then move to the next column. Previously, it was filling horizontally (left to right) before moving to the next row.
The changes were made in the SignalContext.tsx file where the grid configuration and auto-placement logic are defined. The implementation maintains all other functionality while improving the mobile experience with a more efficient use of space and a more logical flag arrangement pattern.
